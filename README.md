<h3>‚ÑπÔ∏è ABOUT</h3>
  <hr>
Solo final project for <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/workshops"> SheCodes Basic </a>. 
<br>
This project marked the end of the workshop, that was centered more in learning the basics of HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
<br>
The project was just to creat a page about anything we enjoyed, in this case, I decided to go for the nostalgia factor and do about Sailor Moon.
<br>
The main goal of the project is to put into use the knowledge with got with the workshop.
