                Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon (美少女戦士セーラームーン), or simply Sailor Moon, it's a very nostalgic manga/anime for
                many of us!
                Launched first as a manga in 1991, created by Naoko Takeuchi, and broadcasted as an anime in 1992, it
                follows the adventures of a girl, <em> Usagi Tsukino </em>, when she encounters a black cat, Luna, who
                gives her a magical brooch. This magical brooch allows her to transform into Sailor Moon, a soldier
                destined to save Earth from the forces of evil.
                <br />
                During her adventures, she will assemble a team of other Sailor Guardians : Sailor Mercury, Sailor
                Venus, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter. Occasionally, a mysterious man called Tuxedo Mask will join them and
                aid them in their battles.

            <span class="h3usagi">Usagi Tsukino</span>
            <br />
            Usagi Tsukino (月野 うさぎ ) is the main protagonist of the series. Usagi is a careless fourteen-year-old girl
            with an enormous capacity
            for love,
            compassion, and understanding. Usagi transforms into the heroine called Sailor Moon, the Guardian of Love
            and Justice.
            At the beginning of the series, she is a self-described immature crybaby who resents fighting evil and wants
            nothing
            more than to be a normal girl. As the story progresses, however, she embraces the chance to use her power to
            protect
            those she cares about.

            <span class="h3ami">Ami Mizuno</span>
            <br />
            Ami Mizuno (水野 亜美 ) is a quiet but intelligent
            fourteen-year-old bookworm in Usagi's class with a rumored IQ of 300. She can transform into
            Sailor Mercury,
            the Guardian of Water and Wisdom. Ami's shy exterior masks a passion for learning and taking care of the
            people around
            her. She hopes to eventually become a doctor like her mother, and tends to be the practical one in the
            group. She is
            secretly a fan of pop culture and romance novels, and becomes embarrassed whenever this is pointed out. Ami
            also uses
            her handheld computer, which is capable of scanning and detecting virtually anything about which she
            requires
            information.

            <span class="h3rei">Rei Hino</span>
            <br />
            Rei Hino (火野 レイ) is an elegant fourteen-year-old miko (a shrine maiden). Because of her work as a Shinto
            priestess, Rei has limited precognition and can dispel or
            nullify evil
            using special ofuda scrolls, even in her civilian form. She transforms into Sailor Mars, the Guardian of
            Fire and Passion. She is very serious and focused, and easily becomes annoyed by Usagi's laziness, although
            she cares
            about her very much. In the anime adaptation, Rei is portrayed as boy-crazy and short-tempered, while in
            the manga and live-action series she is depicted as uninterested in romance and more self-controlled. She
            attends a private Catholic school separate from the other girls.

            who is a
            student in Usagi Tsukino's class and was rumoured to have been expelled from her previous school for
            fighting. Unusually
            tall and strong for a Japanese schoolgirl, she transforms into Sailor Jupiter, the Guardian of Thunder and
            Courage. Both of Makoto's parents died in a plane crash years ago, so she lives alone and takes care of
            herself. She cultivates her physical strength and domestic interests, including housekeeping,
            cooking, and gardening. Makoto excels at hand-to-hand combat. Her dream is to marry a young handsome man and
            to own a
            flower-and-cake shop.

            Guardian of
            Love and Beauty, and leads Sailor Moon's four inner Guardians, while acting as Sailor Moon's bodyguard and
            decoy because
            of their near-identical looks. She dreams of becoming a famous singer and idol, and attends auditions
            whenever she can.
